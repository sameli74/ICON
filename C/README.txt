In this folder, what I am doing is reading a chuck of file and loading it in the computer's memory.
On Raspberry, I have a piece of code that can send data which is called spi.c.
Now, I have to integrate these codes by feeding data from the this folder's functions to the spi.c.

For recovering data, I have to test a matlab script which is located on the desktop this computer(windows.)

Then, test it using input.txt.
